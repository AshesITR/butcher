# Depending on the size of the training data and the model engine specified,
# the output of some models require a lot of computational resources to fit.
# As a result, we have stored the examples of different model objects for
# testing this package under `inst/extdata` and the respective scripts to
# generate each of these model objects under `inst/extdata-scripts`.
#
# We do this to circumvent the need to retrain everytime we want to test
# a new model object. Please refer to the files stored in those folders to
# extend this package.
