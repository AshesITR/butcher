\usage{
axe(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{model object}
}
\value{
axed model object with new butcher subclass assignment
}
\description{
Axe an object.
}
\details{
Reduce the size of a model object so that it takes up less memory on disk.
Currently the model object is stripped down to the point that only the
minimal components necessary for the `predict` function to work remain.
Future adjustments to this function will be needed to avoid removal of
model fit components to ensure it works with other downstream functions.
